A single-port scanner is a network utility that checks the status of a specific port on a given system or network device. Unlike comprehensive port scanners, which scan a variety of ports, the single-port scanner concentrates just on one specific port, allowing for a more specialized study. The single-port scanner sends network packets to a specific port on the target device and interprets the responses. It enables users to determine the accessibility and availability of a specific service or application running on a given port.

Key features:

1. Port Specification: Users provide a single port number to be scanned, allowing for a detailed investigation of the port's state.
2. Targeted Analysis: The scanner focuses solely on the chosen port, reducing resource consumption while increasing efficiency.
3. Response Interpretation: It reads the responses from the target system to determine if the port is open, closed, or filtered.
4. Lightweight and fast: The single-port scanner's targeted design allows for speedy scans, making it perfect for network reconnaissance and troubleshooting.
